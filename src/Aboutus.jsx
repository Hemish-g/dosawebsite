        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Our story changed one morning in alaknanda….
Back in April 2012, Mr. S L Ganapathi asked us to bring the Dosa Inc. truck to his residential complex for some fresh dosa and vada… what we experienced in the next 3 hours completely changed the way we looked at the business for good.

We were sold out in 2 hours of our parking the truck in the Alaknanda neighborhood and that started our “food on the go!” journey - taking our food to the customers rather than waiting for them to arrive.</p>
